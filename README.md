## AWS Build

### AWS S3 Dataset
The image dataset used in the webinar is available here: [cars.zip](/rekognition-dataset/cars.zip)

1.	Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/.
2.	Choose Create bucket.
The Create bucket wizard opens.
3.	In Bucket name, enter a DNS-compliant name for your bucket. For example “mendixcars-yourname”
4.	In Region, choose the AWS Region where you want the bucket to reside.
Choose a Region close to you to minimize latency and costs and address regulatory requirements.
5.	Leave other settings as default, scroll down and click Create bucket button.
6.	Select a new bucket and create folders in the bucket by clicking Create folder button.
Create a folder: cars. Inside it: mercedes, bmw, scratch and upload images

7. Depending on the number of images you can install AWS CLI and use S3 sync command.

<img src="readme-img/console.png"/>

Example Viktoria: 

```aws s3 sync . s3://mybucket```

You can find the image dataset that we used for the webinar inside this repo here: [cars.zip](/rekognition-dataset/cars.zip)

### Rekognition Training
<img src="readme-img/rekognition-steps.png"/>

With Amazon Rekognition Custom Labels, you can identify the objects and scenes in images that are specific to your business needs. For example, you can find your logo in social media posts, identify your products on store shelves, classify machine parts in an assembly line, distinguish healthy and infected plants, or detect animated characters in videos.

No machine learning expertise is required to build your custom model. Rekognition Custom Labels includes AutoML capabilities that take care of the machine learning for you. Once the training images are provided, Rekognition Custom Labels can automatically load and inspect the data, select the right machine learning algorithms, train a model, and provide model performance metrics.

Rekognition Custom Labels builds off of Rekognition’s existing capabilities, which are already trained on tens of millions of images across many categories. Instead of thousands of images, you simply need to upload a small set of training images (typically a few hundred images or less) that are specific to your use case into our easy-to-use console. If your images are already labeled, Rekognition can begin training in just a few clicks. If not, you can label them directly within Rekognition’s labeling interface, or use Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth to label them for you. Once Rekognition begins training from your image set, it can produce a custom image analysis model for you in just a few hours. Behind the scenes, Rekognition Custom Labels automatically loads and inspects the training data, selects the right machine learning algorithms, trains a model, and provides model performance metrics. You can then use your custom model via the Rekognition Custom Labels API and integrate it into your applications.

In this example, we will train to analyze car makers and damages.

```aws rekognition detect-custom-labels --project-version-arn "your model arn" --image "S3Object={Bucket=mendixcars, Name=car2.jpg}" --region us-west-2```

Replace the information in yellow with details of your model and a bucket containing new images for analysis.

## Mendix Setup

We will be using Mendix Studio Pro to develop our app, which requires a Windows Operating system. If you don't have Windows installed, follow the below instructions

### Launch windows EC2 Instance with Mendix Studio Pro Installed

We have published a Cloudformation Template that you can easily launch which is an EC2 Instance with an AMI that contains Mendix Studio Pro already installed

[<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudformation-examples/cloudformation-launch-stack.png">](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=eu-central-1#/stacks/new?stackName=MendixStudioPro-Windows&templateURL=https://mendix-aws.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/windows_mendix.json)

<img src="readme-img/cf1.png">

<img src="readme-img/cf2.png">

### Download release from this repo

Once you have your Windows OS setup, download the latest release from this github repo, you will then have the starter Mendix App that you will be working in

<img src="readme-img/cf4.png">

## Setup your project

Once you have the ```Mendix_AWS_Rekognition.mpk``` package downloaded, open Mendix Studio Pro from the Desktop

Sign in with the account details you setup signing up for Mendix

Import the Project package in order to create your own project

<img src="readme-img/import1.png">

Next, select your choice of version control and location of your project - for this exercise it is recommended to use SVN which Mendix uses in the developer portal

The project will now be created and uploaded to the repository

## The Mendix Build

In order to connect to AWS Rekognition it's important that you set up a number of constants. These constants are environment variables needed to make sure that the app can connect to the right AWS service using your AWS credentials.

### Creating your AWS Keys
To generate an AWS Access and Secret Key follow the steps below: 
1. [Create an AWS Account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/customlabels-dg/su-account.html)
2. [Create an IAM Admin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/customlabels-dg/su-account-user.html)
3. [Create Access Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/customlabels-dg/su-awscli-sdk.html)

### Setting your AWS Access and Secret Keys in Mendix
In order to authenticate with AWS services, it's important that requests are signed using an AWS access and secret key. In Mendix this is done using the Sig4 process. Inside this application, we have already included a module to help with this process.
1. Create access and secret key pair on AWS with access to Rekognition service
2. Copy each of the keys
3. With the application open inside Studio Pro expand the Marketplace modules folder item in the app explorer.
4. Then expand the AWS_Sig4 module.
5. Finally, double click on the Access Key ID and Secret Key then paste the values into each.

<img src="readme-img/app-explorer.jpg"/>

### Setting up the Rekognition constants
The Rekognition module has two constants that need to be set to ensure that the APIs can communicate with the pre-built Rekognition model. These are:
1. AWS_HostPattern - This should be the URL of the endpoint that the API is calling, this will be different depending on the AWS region used for Rekognition. The endpoint URLs can be found here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rekognition.html. 

The URL of the rekognition endpoint is usually in this format: 
```https://rekognition.{aws-region}.amazonaws.com```. But this will be slightly different if you're running from US Gov Or FIPS Cloud.

2. AWS_Region - This should be set to the region where the Rekognition AI model is deployed. The regions can be found here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rekognition.html

These constants can be found inside the AWS_Rekognition module in the marketplace folder. Then open up the constants folder:

<img src="readme-img/app-explorer-rekognition.jpg"/>

Once you have these constants set up you're ready to begin your build.

### Building the domain model
The first step with many Mendix projects is to start with building the data structure. Data is modeled in Mendix using domain models. Each Module in Mendix contains a domain model where you can model the entities, associations and attributes. Follow the below steps to build out the right structure. These instructions assume that you have already pre-installed Mendix Studio Pro 9.12.2+.

1. Using the App Explorer on the left-hand side open up the module "MxRekognitionDemo_Start".
2. Double click on the "Domain model" 
3. Drag an entity from the Toolbox onto the Canvas. The toolbox can be often found on the right-hand side.

<img src="readme-img/mx-build-entity.jpg"/>

4. Double click on the Entity to open the dialog box.
5. Change the name to Picture.

<img src="readme-img/mx-build-picture-entity.jpg"/>

6. Click the "Select" button next to "Generalization".
7. In the Search field type "Image".

<img src="readme-img/mx-build-generalization.jpg"/>

8. Double click on the Image entity.
9. Click the "Ok" button to close the dialog.
10. Drag another entity onto the workbench.

<img src="readme-img/mx-build-label-entity.jpg"/>

11. Double click on this entity and rename it to Label.
12. Under the "Attributes" tab click the "New" button.
13. Name your first attribute "Name".
14. Click "Ok" to close the dialog.
15. Add another Attribute and call this one "Confidence".
16. Under the Data Type Dropdown select "Decimal".

<img src="readme-img/mx-build-label-properties.jpg"/>

17. Click "Ok" and then "Ok" to close both dialogs.
18. Associate the two entities by dragging the arrow from Label to Picture. This will create a relationship between these two entities.

<img src="readme-img/mx-build-label-associate.jpg"/>

### Building the User Interface
1. Open up the folder "Pages" inside the "MxRekognitionDemo_Start" module.
2. Double click on "Home_Start" to open up.
3. From the right-hand side open up the "Toolbox" and then "Building Blocks".

<img src="readme-img/mx-build-page-build.jpg"/>

4. Drag the Block labeled "Label Block" to the bottom empty space.
5. Drag the other building block "Picture Block" to the space above.

<img src="readme-img/mx-build-page-build-blocks.jpg"/>

6. Next, we need to connect these up to our Picture object. Click on the widgets tab on the right-hand side.
7. Drag on a "Data view" widget onto the page at the top.

<img src="readme-img/mx-build-page-dataview.jpg"/>

8. Double click on the widget to open up the properties dialog.
9. Under "Data source" select "Nanoflow". You can find more information on Nanoflows here: [Nanoflows](https://docs.mendix.com/refguide/nanoflows/)
10. Click the "Select" button.

<img src="readme-img/mx-build-page-datasource.jpg"/>

11. Click the "New" button at the bottom of the popup.
12. Give the Nanoflow a name like "DSO_NewPicture". You can find more information on naming conventions here: [Best practices](https://docs.mendix.com/howto/general/dev-best-practices/#341-entity-event-microflows)

<img src="readme-img/mx-build-page-get-picture.jpg"/>

13. Click the "Show" button to open up the nanoflow and close the dialog.

<img src="readme-img/mx-build-page-nanoflow.jpg"/>

14. Using the Toolbox drag on a "Create Object" action.

<img src="readme-img/mx-build-page-create-action.jpg"/>

15. Double click on the action and set the entity type to our new "Picture" entity.

<img src="readme-img/mx-build-page-select-entity.jpg"/>

16. Double click on the "Endpoint" represented by a red dot. 
17. Configure it to return an "Object" 

<img src="readme-img/mx-build-page-nanoflow-return.jpg"/>

18. Set the value to the newly created Object.

<img src="readme-img/mx-build-page-nanoflow-set-return.jpg"/>

19. Open up the "Home_Start" page again.
20. Drag the entiere existing layout into the Dataview.

<img src="readme-img/mx-build-layout-drag.gif"/>

21. Double click on the Picture control and connect it to the "Picture" entity.
22. Double click on the "List view" and connect it to the associated entity "Label"

<img src="readme-img/mx-build-page-listview-association.jpg"/>

23. Configure the left parameter in the ListView by double-clicking on the text item, then use then connect Parameter {1} up to "Name".

<img src="readme-img/mx-build-page-setting-labels.jpg"/>

24. Configure the right parameter in the ListView by double-clicking on the text item, then use then connect Parameter {1} up to "Confidence".

<img src="readme-img/mx-build-page-setting-labels-confidence.jpg"/>

### Building the logic
Logic in Mendix is defined using Microflows for server-side logic and Nanoflows for client-side. Both of these concepts use the same modeling paradigm. Allowing you to define logic using actions, decisions and loops.

To perform the logic needed we'll create a Nanoflow which will open up the camera, save the picture, process it by Rekognition, and save the results. Here are the steps:

1. Right-click on the "Take a picture" button and click "Edit on click action".
2. Select from the dropdown "Call a Nanoflow".
3. Click the "New" button.
4. Enter the name "ACT_TakePicture" and click "OK".

<img src="readme-img/mx-build-page-edit-action.jpg"/>

5. Open up the newly built Nanoflow.
6. Drag and Drop from the Toolbox a "Take Picture" action.

<img src="readme-img/mx-build-logic-take-picture.jpg"/>

7. Configure the parameters as follows:
    - Picture = NewPicture
    - Show Confirmation Screen = false
    - Picture Quality = low
    - Maximum width = empty
    - Maximum height = empty

<img src="readme-img/mx-build-logic-take-picture-options.jpg"/>

8. From the Toolbox drag the detect custom labels action and configure as follows:
    - ProjectARN = Your Rekognition ARN
    - Image = NewPicture
    - MaxResults = 10
    - MinConfidence = 0
    - AWS_Region = your region

<img src="readme-img/mx-build-logic-rekognition.jpg"/>

9. Add a Loop activity to the microflow and connect it to the CustomLabel List

<img src="readme-img/mx-build-logic-loop.jpg"/>

10. Inside the loop drag a retrieve action to retrieve the BoundingBox.
11. Connect up the retrieve action by double-clicking on the action, selecting "By association", clicking "Select", and selecting the Bounding Box association.

<img src="readme-img/mx-build-logic-retrieve-action.jpg"/>

12. Drag on a "Create" action into the loop and draw a line from the bounding box to the "Create" action.

<img src="readme-img/mx-build-logic-create-action.jpg"/>

13. Configure the activity by selecting the Entity "Label".
14. Set 3 Members to the following:
    - Label_Picture = $NewPicture
    - Confidence = $IteratorCustomLabel/Confidence
    - Name = $IteratorCustomLabel/Name

<img src="readme-img/mx-build-logic-create-configure.jpg"/>

15. Finally add a bounding box activity and configure as follows:
    - Class name = 'img-container'
    - Bounding box = $BoundingBox
    - Custom label = $IteratorCustomLabel
    - High Confidence Threshold = 80
    - Medium Confidence Threshold = 50

<img src="readme-img/mx-build-logic-bounding-box.jpg"/>

16. We're now complete so we need to run the project locally. Click the Green play Icon on the top right.

<img src="readme-img/mx-build-run-app.jpg"/>

17. Open up your app locally on your laptop by going to http://localhost:8080. If you wish to try it on your phone you'll need to create a secure tunnel using something like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to ensure that the camera on your phone can be accessed. Mobile browsers only allow you to access the camera over a secure connection using https.
